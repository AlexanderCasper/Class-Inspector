# Class-Inspector

This JAVA application was a little exercise for my advanced programming exam and uses JavaFX and Reflection.
It gives you some information about the class (or primitive type) you enter in the text box.
You must use fully qualified class names (except for primitive types). 
If there is a match with a class file, the text box is highlighted in green.
